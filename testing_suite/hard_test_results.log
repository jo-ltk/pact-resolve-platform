=== INITIATING EXTREME HARD TEST (SECURITY FUZZING) ===
TARGET: Every discovered route in /app/api/
RULES: Any 500 Internal Server Error means the API cracked (FAIL).
       400/401/403/404/405/422 mean the API defended itself (PASS).


=================================
       HARD TEST RESULTS       
=================================
Total Attacks Attempted : 582
Guards Held (Passed)    : 582
Cracked (Failed w/ 500) : 0

🛡️ ABSOLUTE FORTRESS! All APIs survived the fuzzing without throwing a single 500 Server Error.
