   INITIATING ULTIMATE CYBERSECURITY & LOGIC TEST 
==================================================

-> [SETUP] Creating Test Accounts...
   [+] Admin and Standard User accounts created and authenticated.

==================================================
🛡️ SCENARIO 1: Privilege Escalation (The 'Nosy User')
==================================================
   ✅ PASS: Standard user was correctly blocked with status 403.

==================================================
🔄 SCENARIO 2: End-to-End Logical Integrity (CRUD Cycle)
==================================================
   ✅ CREATE: Successfully inserted new event into database.
   ✅ READ: Verified the inserted event exists via GET.
   ✅ UPDATE: Successfully pushed a title modification request.
   ✅ DELETE: Successfully deleted the event from the database.
   ✅ CRUD COMPLETE: The event was proven to be fully erased.

==================================================
🚦 SCENARIO 3: Rate Limiting & DoS Stress Test
==================================================
   -> Firing 500 concurrent requests at the server instantly...
   [+] Execution Time: 10572ms
   [+] Processed (200 OK): 500
   [+] Rate Limited (429): 0
   [+] Crashed/Timeout (500s): 0

   ⚠️ WARNING: Your server successfully handled 500 requests simultaneously without crashing (Strong CPU!), but you have ZERO rate-limiting implemented. A bot could easily abuse this and raise your database query costs.
